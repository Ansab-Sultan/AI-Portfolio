# Hello, I'm Ansab
 I'm AI Engineer specializing in machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and LangChain.

## Objective
My journey as an AI Engineer has driven me to innovate and solve complex problems using machine learning and deep learning. Seeking opportunities to push the boundaries of AI technology and collaborate on impactful projects that address real-world challenges.

## Projects

### Project 1: [Twitter Sentiment Analysis using Logistic Regression](https://github.com/Ansab-Sultan/Sentiment-Analysis/tree/main/Twitter%20Sentiment%20Analysis%20using%20Logistic%20Regression)
- **Description:** Twitter Sentiment Analysis is a Python project that leverages machine learning techniques to analyze sentiment in Twitter data. The project preprocesses text data, trains a logistic regression model, and evaluates its performance. Additionally, it includes a ROC curve plot to visualize the model's performance. A GUI is also implemented for the ease of users.
- **Technologies Used:**
  - Python
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn
  - nltk
  - matplotlib
  - pickle
  - streamlit

### Project 2: [Melanoma Cancer Image Classification](https://github.com/Ansab-Sultan/Image-Classification/tree/main/Melanoma%20Cancer%20Image%20Classification)
- **Description:** Diabetic retinopathy is a common complication of diabetes and a leading cause of blindness. This project focuses on the early detection of diabetic retinopathy through the classification of retinal images using deep learning techniques. Early detection can facilitate timely intervention and treatment, potentially preventing vision loss in diabetic patients. A GUI is also implemented for the ease of users.
- **Technologies Used:**
  - TensorFlow
  - Keras
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib
  - streamlit
   
### Project 3: [Website Developer Assistant](https://github.com/Ansab-Sultan/ChatBots/tree/main/Website%20Developer%20Assistant)
- **Description:** The Website Developer Assistant project aims to support users in website development tasks by offering guidance and code snippets through natural language processing techniques. Leveraging LangChain, this project utilizes an existing chatbot model to understand user queries and generate relevant responses, including HTML and CSS code snippets.
- **Technologies Used:**
  - Language Models (Hugging Face's Transformers library)
  - Streamlit
  - Python
  - HTML/CSS
