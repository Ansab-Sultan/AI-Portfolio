# Hello, I'm Ansab
 I'm AI Engineer specializing in machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and LangChain.

## Objective
 My journey as an AI Engineer has driven me to innovate and solve complex problems using machine learning and deep learning. Seeking opportunities to push the boundaries of AI technology and collaborate on 
 impactful projects that address real-world challenges.

## Projects

### Project 1: [Twitter Sentiment Analysis using Logistic Regression](https://github.com/Ansab-Sultan/Sentiment-Analysis/tree/main/Twitter%20Sentiment%20Analysis%20using%20Logistic%20Regression)
- Twitter Sentiment Analysis is a Python project that leverages machine learning techniques to analyze sentiment in Twitter data. The project preprocesses text data, trains a logistic regression model, and evaluates its performance. Additionally, it includes a ROC curve plot to visualize the model's performance. A GUI is also implemented for the ease of users.

### Project 2: [Melanoma Cancer Image Classification](https://github.com/Ansab-Sultan/Image-Classification/tree/main/Melanoma%20Cancer%20Image%20Classification)
- Diabetic retinopathy is a common complication of diabetes and a leading cause of blindness. This project focuses on the early detection of diabetic retinopathy through the classification of retinal images using 
 deep learning techniques. Early detection can facilitate timely intervention and treatment, potentially preventing vision loss in diabetic patients. A GUI is also implemented for the ease of users.

### Project 3: [Website Developer Assistant](https://github.com/Ansab-Sultan/ChatBots/tree/main/Website%20Developer%20Assistant)
- The Website Developer Assistant project aims to support users in website development tasks by offering guidance and code snippets through natural language processing techniques. Leveraging LangChain, this project 
 utilizes an existing chatbot model to understand user queries and generate relevant responses, including HTML and CSS code snippets.

### Project 4: [Emotion Detection with LSTM Model](https://github.com/Ansab-Sultan/Emotion-Analysis)
- This project focuses on emotion detection in textual data using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model. It encompasses data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and a 
 Streamlit web application for real-time emotion prediction.

### Project 5: [Diabetes Prediction using XGBoost](https://github.com/Ansab-Sultan/Diabetes-Prediction)
- This project aims to predict diabetes using machine learning techniques, particularly focusing on XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting). The dataset utilized in this project consists of various health parameters, 
 including glucose levels, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin levels, body mass index (BMI), age, and pregnancies, to predict whether a patient has diabetes or not.
